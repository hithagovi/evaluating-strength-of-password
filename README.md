# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
To understand the characteristics of a strong password and evaluate multiple passwords using online password strength checkers.

## Tools Used
- [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com) – For evaluating password strength.

## Password Testing

| Password Example     | Length | Complexity (Upper, Lower, Number, Symbol) | Score (%) | Feedback from Tool |
|----------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| `password123`        | 11     | Lowercase + Numbers                        | 26%       | Too common, easily guessable. |
| `P@ssword123`        | 11     | Uppercase + Lowercase + Numbers + Symbol   | 54%       | Better complexity but still based on common word. |
| `Qx!9bR$7Lm`         | 10     | Fully random mix of all types               | 86%       | Strong password, difficult to crack. |
| `tR!9kW&8qLpZ@3`     | 14     | Uppercase + Lowercase + Numbers + Symbols   | 100%      | Excellent — very high complexity and length. |

## Best Practices Learned
1. **Length Matters** – Minimum 12–14 characters recommended.
2. **Use Variety** – Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
3. **Avoid Dictionary Words** – Common words are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
4. **Randomness is Key** – Predictable patterns weaken passwords.
5. **Don’t Reuse Passwords** – Each account should have a unique password.
6. **Consider a Password Manager** – To securely store and generate strong passwords.

## Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** – Tries every possible combination of characters.
- **Dictionary Attack** – Uses precompiled lists of common words and passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing** – Reuses leaked username/password combos across sites.
- **Social Engineering** – Tricks users into revealing their passwords.

## Impact of Complexity on Security
- Short, simple passwords are cracked in seconds using automated tools.
- Adding symbols, numbers, and mixed case exponentially increases the time required to crack.
- Randomized, long passwords are highly resistant to brute force and dictionary attacks.

**Example Strong Passwords** (Do NOT use these directly):
- `F!9pX2@rQm7#Lz`
- `M^4vH&8tP$1kRjQ`

**Conclusion:**  
A strong password should be long, unique, and unpredictable. Using all character types and avoiding personal information drastically improves password resilience.
